# Multi Step Rollout Training


Note that I can't do this from my new 30k iteration base right now, since I
logged offline, and for some reason I can't use mlflow to read from an offline
logged run.

I think order of operations should be:
1. Update and finish off AML logging, just to get that done
2. Figure out how to get offline logging working, what's up with that


So for now... maybe I can just start from the 60k, 120k runs?
